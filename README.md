# Dataset helper 

## What is it 
This simple app is purely for fast and easy data cleaning of JSON files. 

## Functions
- user can paste JSON object or load JSON file into the app (need to do optimisation for large files)
- user can select how many items on the page (5, 10, 15)
- can drag and move around JSON object to change their ordering
- allows for "focus mode"

## Focus mode: 
- select the field you want to focus on, and the textbox will be bigger for that field, making it way easier to edit JSON data

P.S. This was meant for my own personal use and will also be improving its UI and UX down the line.
